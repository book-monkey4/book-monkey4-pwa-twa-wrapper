# book-monkey4-pwa-twa-wrapper

This repository contains all the files needed to generate an Android App from the [BookMonkey PWA](https://github.com/book-monkey4/book-monkey4-pwa).
It's contents were generated by executing the following command and filling out all the necessary steps:

```bash
npx @bubblewrap/cli init --manifest https://bm4-pwa.angular-buch.com/manifest.json
```

The final app (`*.apk`) can be build by running:

```bash
npx @bubblewrap/cli build
```

The final build APK can only be uploaded to the Google Play Console as a valid app, when the signature defined in `assetlinks.json` will match with the signature of the developer who registered this app in the Play Console and who has the corresponding fingerprint.
